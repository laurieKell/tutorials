### Stock Status and Reference points (LAURIE)       

To assess the status of a stock, reference points are needed. Is a stock overfished, or is overfishing going on. These aspects are considered in the light of stock status versus reference points.

In general, two types of reference points can be distinguished:
1. Target reference points, such as Fmsy and Bmsy and
2. Limit reference points, such as B~lim~, F~lim~ (IOTC), F~SPR~ or 20%~SSB0~ (ICCAT, SPRFMO)

Only the target reference points are shown in the Kobe plot below, in relation to the estimated stock size and fishing mortality.

**Figure `r iFig=iFig+1; iFig`.** Example of Kobe plot for a pelagic fish being sustainably fished (green area), overfished and overfishing going on (red area) and being either overfished (yellow left) and with overfishing (yellow right).

## Reference points under biomass dynamic models

Under biomass dynamic models, target reference points are rather easily defined. There are two parameters crucial in calculating the reference points: [inline equation ]

## Reference points under integrated (age-based) models

The target reference points can be estimated based on life-history characteristics such as growth, natural mortality, fecundity etc. To get an estimate out an assumption on recruitment needs to be made as well. For this purpose, often stock-recruitment relationships are used. 





* Types of reference points used (LAURIE)
    + Fmsy, Bmsy, Bpa, Blim, B0, B40
    <span style="color:red"> we dont use BPA; BLIM, B40, it would be better to talk about targets and limits</span>
