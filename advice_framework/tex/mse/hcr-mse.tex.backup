\subsection{Conditioning}
There will always be alternative aims for constructing operating model to evaluate MPs, which may include the following, although the list is not attempted to be exhaustive. 
The operating model corresponds to one of the following.
(1) The currently used assessment model, this implies that assessment models describe nature almost perfectly.
(2) Best fit to all available and justified data (in Bayesian models priors would be non-informative, i.e. only data would “speak”). This approach is based on the idea that all relevant data sets are available and that data is the only thing that matters when considering future events.
(3) Best description of all available information in relation to the fitting of historic data (in Bayesian models priors would describe in a formal way the knowledge of scientists related to the validity of information sources). It is believed that the future will be like the past with no information to the contrary. Probabilities, other than those available from data, may come from, for example a meta-analysis.
(4) Best prediction of the future dynamics, given the historic data. In this case, the emphasis is on expert beliefs and other such prior type information about future processes being relevant when testing the behaviour of management systems in the future (i.e. the focus is on the future, not on fitting historic data). For example, climatic change studies may show that a regime shift is likely and should be taken into account when providing future advice. This was the case in the Baltic, where high precipitation has impacted various stocks, and this change was predicted before fisheries scientists could provide low enough p-values from their data sets. It is important therefore that operational models are flexible, so that they can deal with such aspects. The use of priors in the operational model would offer a flexible way to deal with these various elements. 
It may be considered, that (4) is related to the testing of the robustness of MPs to alternative hypothesis about the dynamics and that (2) represents the base case. As the aim of the OM modelling is to test different types of plausible hypothesis in a management framework, type (3) and (4) models are most important types after the base case is agreed.

\subsection{Commission}

12. Identification of matters for presentation to and consideration by the Commission, including any recommendations as well as proposed next steps for SWGSM 

There was broad agreement that the first meeting of the Working Group was very successful and the SWGSM made the following recommendations. There should be another meeting of the Working Group in 2015. On the issue of the possible subject matters to be discussed at the next meeting, many delegations were of the view that it would be useful to proceed with practical examples that could help advance the dialogue for individual stocks. However, it was also suggested that dialogue of a general nature continue on issues such as acceptable levels of risk, targets, limits and time horizons. Noting the low participation, it was recommended that the Commission consider providing funds for two members per delegation (one manager and one scientist) for those CPCs needing assistance. It was also suggested that the next meeting should have greater balance in the numbers of participating scientists and managers. 

The SWGSM agreed that skipjack, which will be assessed in 2014, would be a good candidate to examine harvest control rules for a stock that is in a healthy status. North Atlantic albacore and North Atlantic swordfish, stocks for which the SCRS has already advanced HCR development and testing, were also considered as good candidates. Many delegations also proposed that Atlantic bluefin tuna be considered as a priority species and the working group recommended that it be discussed at the next meeting. The management of this species has required substantial quota reductions and fishery indicators suggest that it is rapidly recovering. For this reason, the development of a HCR for bluefin is needed so that future TAC adjustments can be made in a reliable and defensible fashion. In order to eliminate data gaps that affect the timeliness of stock assessments, it would be important to also consider improvements in fishery monitoring, including real-time reporting.
